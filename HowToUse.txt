2. Extract the downlaod folder and copy the "FAACIFP18" file to  folder "CIFP file"

3. Open the solution file and run the code, the output database "CIFP.db" will be in "CIFPDatabase/output/"

What each function do:

1. LoadCIFP
   load the CIFP file, consider each line as an element of string array "CIFPFileData"

2. SortCIFP
   categorize the string in "CIFPFileData", use ARINC424-17 as reference, use the 5th letter and the 13rd letter of the string to define the data type, which include:
   - waypoint
   - airport (have heliport, but not included in this code)
   		-> STAR
   		-> SID
   		-> Runway
   		-> APPCH
   		-> airport terminal waypoint
   - airspace

3. Tool
   some functions that need use multiple time in decoding the CIFP string
   e.g: convert latitude/longitude from degree to decimal; get defination/description(from ARINC424) of the letter in CIFP  

4. OtherTool
    some funtions that need use multiple time in managint the data string
